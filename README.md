‬This project was focused on developing code to create various filters and effects to change the digital‬
appearance of images. Through implementation of such alteration techniques, I explored array‬
manipulation, the fundamentals of RGB color values, and expressed my creativity through my‬
‭resulting digital images. By the end of the project, I successfully created multiple filters that applied‬
specific alterations to images.‬
